# Strange Machines

The UW Game Jam has kicked off, and this year's theme is "Strange Machines"!

### Game Ideas Thus Far

- **Fount**: You start as a normal game but there's no pause or anything, and you have to slowly create yourself the game, by first building a pause button and then buttons in the pause menu, then eventually you can't progress, and you have to start digging through the computer into the hardware and "programming" the game logic with like, drag and drop?
- **xX_Smudge_Xx**: Game where there are objects being tossed into your "area," and you drag them into each other to evolve them! They start evolving into some... very strange machines that start interacting with your other objects! Eventually, you can take your army of strange things and fight other armies of strange things outside of your "area."
